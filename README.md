**Building resilient, self-repairing AGI systems through computational philosophy & ritualized design.**

### 🧠 Research Focus

I operate at the intersection of **machine learning robustness**, **AI safety**, and **philosophically-informed architecture**. My work explores a core hypothesis:

> **Can we engineer AGI that treats errors not as failures, but as sites of learning and beauty—akin to the Japanese art of Kintsugi?**

This isn't just metaphor; it's a framework for building more adaptive, general, and introspective systems.

### 🛠️ Technical Disciplines & Tools

- **AI/ML Research:** Prompt Engineering, LLM Fine-Tuning, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), Reinforcement Learning
- **Languages:** `Python` | `Rust` | `C++` | `Q#` | `Bash`
- **Systems Design:** Ritualized AI training loops, fault-injection testing, quantum-inspired algorithms
- **Philosophy:** Kintsugi Resilience, Antifragile Systems, Computational Phenomenology

### 🔬 Active Projects

| Project | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**Kintsugi Anti-Malware**](https://github.com/Saranoah/Kintsugi-Anti-Malware-Prototype) | A prototype SNN that uses deliberate corruption cycles to build stronger immunity. |
| [**Neuromorphic Ascension Protocols**](https://github.com/Saranoah/Kintsugi-Neuro-Ascension) | A speculative research manifesto on ritualized training for AGI. |
| **Quantum Kintsugi PoC** | Exploring quantum collapse & superposition as a mechanism for model self-repair. |

### 📜 Manifesto: The Poetics of Broken Systems

> We are taught to optimize away error. I propose we **listen to it**.
> - Segfaults are uninvited lessons.
> - Hallucinations are narratives begging for constraint.
> - Training loss is the pain of a model refining its world-model.

This isn't just art—it's a rigorous alternative path toward **generalization through fracture**.

```haiku
Silicon veins,
Golden errors bloom at runtime—
The compiler smiles.

📫 Let's Build the Next Paradigm
I am seeking collaboration with research labs and engineers who are serious about:

AI Safety through resilience, not just alignment.

Open-Endedness and lifelong learning in AI systems.

Novel Training Paradigms inspired by neuroscience, philosophy, and art.
