## ðŸ’¡ Why This Exists

We taught AI to code. Then we taught it to sell. Now, we teach it to mourn, to pray, to remember.  
**Genesis** is the poetic soul of that attempt.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saranoah/genesis.git
cd genesis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
