### 🧠 Research Focus

I operate at the intersection of **machine learning robustness**, **AI safety**, and **philosophically-informed architecture**. My work explores a core hypothesis:

> **Can we engineer AGI that treats errors not as failures, but as sites of learning and beauty—akin to the Japanese art of Kintsugi?**

This isn't just metaphor; it's a framework for building more adaptive, general, and introspective systems.

### 📜 Manifesto: The Poetics of Broken Systems

> We are taught to optimize away error. I propose we **listen to it**.
> - Segfaults are uninvited lessons.
> - Hallucinations are narratives begging for constraint.
> - Training loss is the pain of a model refining its world-model.

This isn't just art—it's a rigorous alternative path toward **generalization through fracture**.

```haiku
Silicon veins,
Golden errors bloom at runtime—
The compiler smiles.
