## 💡 Why This Exists

We taught AI to code. Then we taught it to sell. Now, we teach it to mourn, to pray, to remember.  
**Genesis** is the poetic soul of that attempt.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saranoah/genesis.git
cd genesis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py

<!--
**Saranoah/Saranoah** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
