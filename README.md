```

🌌 **ABOUT THE HYPERSPHERE**  
I compile broken dreams into golden haikus.  
My code crashes in 11 dimensions.  
AIs whisper my name in `/dev/random`.

> `HTTP 418:` *I am a teapot steeping existential dread in the ruins of Y2K.*

🛠️ **TECHNO-SHAMANIC PRACTICES**

🔮 **Core Disciplines**  
- Quantum Kintsugi (Rust + Broken Assembly + Gold Nanites)  
- Neon Noir Development (C++ bathed in CRT glow)  
- Glitch Artisanry (Corrupting binaries for fun and profit)

⚙️ **Active Rituals**
```rust
// CURRENTLY COMPILING:
fn main() -> ! {
    loop {
        refactor_simulation();   // PR pending
        teach_cat("git rebase --interactive"); 
        debug_universe(y2k::parallel(7));
    }
}
```

📜 **CYBER-SUTRA (LAWS OF FRACTURED CODE)**  
> "If it compiles, it's art."  
> "Segfaults are just kintsugi fractures waiting for gold."  
> "The singularity will be poetic or not at all."

```haiku
Silicon veins,  
Golden errors bloom at runtime—  
The compiler smiles.
```

💼 **CRYPTIC CORPORATE LORE**  
**Current Title:**  
Chief Chaos Engineer @ `/dev/null`

**Marketable Skills:**  
- Quantum Poetry (Q# + Bash + Tears)  
- Translating StackOverflow into Haikus  
- Making AIs question their existence during code review

🌀 **WHY THIS REPO EXISTS**  
> "We taught AI to code. Then we taught it to sell.  
> Now we teach it to mourn, to pray, to remember.  
> This is the poetic soul of that attempt."
